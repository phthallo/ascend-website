## Ascend
This project was built at a 3-day hackathon called Ascend. Ascend is the first-ever summit through Hack Clubs intitiative - Days-Of-Service. Held at sunny Los Angeles, California. Teenagers came together from all-over the world to build projects and ascend to the next level.

## Prompt
The prompt for this was project was spaceship instructions. One of Spaxe X's most used apps on the factory floor displays the instructions of how to build each part of a rocket. Build an app to be able to display instructions, loop & interate through taks, & call for inspections when needed. With this prompt we created **Stellar Blueprints**.

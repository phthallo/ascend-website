## Prompt
This project was developed over the course of three days as part of [Ascend](https://ascend.hackclub.com).
The prompt for this project was an instructionary app for building spacecraft, considering one of SpaceX's most used apps on the factory floor displays the instructions of how to build them. With this prompt we created **Stellar Blueprint**.

## Stack
Next.js, React and TailwindCSS, with Prisma for the backend. 


### Collaborators
